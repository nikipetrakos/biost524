# biost524

For my clinical trials course at UW (BIOST 524), the culminating course project was to work in teams to create a study protocol for a mock randomized clinical trial. My group designed a trial studying restrictive versus liveral red blood cell transfusion strategies in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. The clinicians in the group did the bulk of the clinical background, and myself along with another fellow biostatistics student did the bulk of the statistical methods work. The final report is included in this repo.
